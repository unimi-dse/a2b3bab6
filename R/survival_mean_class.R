# Analyse survival rate based on ticket class.
#' @title Relationship between ticket class and survival.
#' @description This function analyses the relationship between survival rate and ticket class of the passengers.
#' @param df The Titanic dataframe which gets imported after running the import_data functions.
#' @param sub_class: Subset dataframe containing the Class for passengers and their respective survival rate.
#' @param sboc : Variable which stores the the analysis of the mean ticket class
#' @param plot_sboc: Variable to store the graph behind the analysis
#' @param sboc_output : a variable which stores both the analysis and plot results in a list.
#' @return the analysis behind the relationship between the ticket class and also the graph based on the relationship.
#' @examples survival_mean_class()
#' @export
