# Calculate the mean age of survivors
#' @title Survivor Age Mean
#' @description This function analyses and returns the mean age among the people who survived.Its also gives the age group, which is most likely to survive.
#' @param df: The titanic train data set which we imported and converted to df dataframe.
#' @param sboa Variable to store the output of the analysis.
#' @param plot_age : subset to store a dataframe containting age and survival rate.
#' @param graph_age : variable containing the graph representing the relationship between age and survival rate
#' @return The mean age of the survivors and the most proobable age of survival and the graphical representation between age and survival.
#' @import ggplot2
#' @examples survivor_age_mean()
#' @export
