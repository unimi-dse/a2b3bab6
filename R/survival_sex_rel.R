# Analyse survival rate based on Sex.
#' @title Survival rate based on Sex.
#' @description This function analyses the relationship between Survival rate and sex of the passengers.
#' @param df: The titanic train data set which we imported and converted to  dataframe.
#' @param sub_sex : subset which contains just the sex and survival rate of passenger
#' @param fem_total :total females in the ship
#' @param male_total :total males in the ship
#' @param sur_sex :subset with only survived passengers
#' @param female_survived : total female survived
#' @param male_survived : total male survived
#' @param mf_total: total analysis
#' @param plot_sex : graphical representation of the relationship
#' @return sex_rel_ans : returns the analysis and also the graphical representation.
#' @import ggplot2
#' @examples survival_sex_rel()
#' @export
